# DB_Final
This is my final project for CS 340, Intro to Databases, produced in collaboration with Austin Welborn.

It is designed mainly to demonstrate the MySQL techniques we learned over the course of the class. 
This project demonstrates a handful of moderately complex MySQL statements, using Major League Soccer as a theme.

Users can view information on teams, players, stadiums, and individual games. Special attention was given to crafting queries that 
mandate joins across different tables within the database.
